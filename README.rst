Atom Data
=========

References for atomic species and spectral lines commonly used in atomic physics experiments.

.. warning::
   This is a very early stage project, patiece is requested, and contributions are appreciated!

The goal is to create practical atom data documentation based on open source documents,
so that the information can be adjusted easily. This includes goals such as:

* multiple output formats (aiming at HTML, PDF, EPUB)
* generating plots and level diagrams programically
* cover all commonly used atomic species for ion traps, atomic clocks, BEC, and related experiments

The inspiration for this project is `Daniel Steck's Alkali D Line Data <http://steck.us/alkalidata/>`_
page, which I'd like to recommend for Cs, Na, Rb85, and Rb87 data!
